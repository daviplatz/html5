# 1. The Language of the Web

## The web killed the radio star

* To make web pages, you create files written in the HyperText Markup language (HTML for short) and place them on a web server.

* Once youâ€™ve put your files on a web server, any browser can retrieve your web pages over the Internet.

* And there are a lot of PCs and devices
connected to the Internet all running web
browsers.(Everybody)

* The HTML in your web page tells the
browser what it needs to know to display
your page. 

## What does the web server do?
* A web server works 24/7 waiting for a request (imaeges,videos or whatever), and when it's requested it finds the resource and sends back to the browser

## What you write (the html)
